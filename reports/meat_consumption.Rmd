# Introduction

I was inspired to check out this data by the instagram page "chartrdaily," who on Thanksgiving posted this visualization to their channel: ![Turkey Consumption Over Time](./chartr_turkey.png)

In general, meat consumption is both a cultural value that changes over time and an important driving factor in greenhouse gas emissions. Raising animals is not very water- or energy-efficient, which has fueled a recent push away from the worst types of meat not for animal rights issues but for environmental ones. 

Beef both requires the most water and produces the most greenhouse gases: ![Water Requirement per Gram of Protein](meat_water_total.svg)

![Greenhouse Gases Emitted per Gram of Protein](meat_efficiency.png)

And for this reason, beef is the least energy-efficient meat, followed by mutton, pork, and then poultry.

Environmentally, we would prefer to transition to eating more poultry/pork and less beef/mutton. In this data analysis, I will examine whether that transition to poultry and pork has been happening. 

# Thanksgiving

To begin, I recreate the chart displayed by chartrdaily: annual per-capita turkey consumption over time. 

```{r}
label_lbs <- function(num) {
  str_c(num, " lbs")
}
meat %>% 
  filter(meat == "Turkey") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, per_cap_retail_wt)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(5, 23, 2.5), 
    limits = c(7.5, 20), 
    labels = label_lbs
    ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Annual per capita turkey consumption", 
    title = "Turkey consumption peaked 25 years ago", 
    caption = "Source: USDA"
  )
```
Though we imagine a Thanksgiving turkey as a quintessential American tradition, it appears that it's actually a relatively new tradition, with the idea really taking off during the 1980s in particular. Since then, Americans seem to have been finding replacements for the Big Bird. Personally, I say good riddance!

# Comparing types of meat

When I originally saw that graphic, I wondered how turkey consumption compares to consumption of other types of meat over time (beef, pork, and chicken in particular). I suspected that it has never really compared, as turkey is mainly a lunchmeat with one day in the limelight each year. 
```{r}
meat %>% 
  filter(!meat %in% c("Poultry", "Red Meat")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, per_cap_retail_wt, color = meat)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = label_lbs
    ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Annual per capita consumption", 
    title = "Trends in American meat consumption", 
    subtitle = "Preferences are changing", 
    caption = "Source: USDA", 
    color = "Meat"
  )
```

In 1970, beef was king in America. However, only six years later it would hit its peak per-capita consumption and twenty-two years later chicken surpassed it as Americans' most consumed meat. In fact, since 1970 there has been a consistently decreasing trend in beef consumption -- a decrease that is healthier for Americans and for the environment in general. Meanwhile, pork consumption has remained almost constant during the time period examined. 

Turkey has always been consumed far less than beef or chicken, but still far more than either veal or lamb/mutton (neither of which is consumed in any meaningful amount). 

Since fish is not farmed in the same was as livestock are, the USDA doesn't keep statistics on them, but I suspect that, if we could include pounds of fish consumed on this graph, we would see a rapid increase over this time period as well. 

# Poultry vs. Red Meat

Poultry is significantly better for the environment than red meat is. As such, I want to compare consumption of red meat vs. poultry to see how Americans' meat preferences have impacted the environment. Based on the previous graph, I expect that the two will have a similar relationship to the one between chicken and beef. 

```{r}
meat %>% 
  filter(meat %in% c("Poultry", "Red Meat")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, per_cap_retail_wt, color = meat)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = label_lbs
    ) + 
  labs(
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Annual per capita consumption", 
    title = "Trends in American meat consumption", 
    subtitle = "Preferences are changing", 
    caption = "Source: USDA", 
    color = "Meat"
  )
```

Because poultry is made up of turkey and chicken and red meat is pork and beef, the relationship between red meat vs. poultry is no the same as beef vs. chicken. Red meat remained buoyed by pork's consistent popularity until this decade, in which it looks like poultry is starting to overtake red meat as the preferred American meat type. 

Americans' consumption of red meat has been consistently decreasing since 1970, while their consumption of poultry has been increasing to replace it. I, for one, avoid red meat when I can and this plot shows that many Americans are making that same decision year after year. This is good news for the planet and for Americans' health too.
